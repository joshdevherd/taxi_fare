# taxi_fare

This is my first solo Java project created so I can practice creating classes, objects and methods as well as using mathematical operators to print to the terminal a total taxi fare based on several variables , including: 
- a ride type multiplier 
- miles travelled 
- tips 
 
You can also access details about the Taxi, such as:
- color
- name of driver
- ride type multiplier
